A plugin is a python script which loads the temporay .temp file which the text editor creates for the time the plugin is being run, containing the currently loaded file in the text editor, and makes changes to the temp file, which will be loaded when the plugin is done being executed. Alternativly, the plugin does not nessicarily need to make changes to the temp file at all, it may just load the temp file and maybe do analytics on it. In theory, the plugin doesn't need to do anything with the temp file at all, it just needs to be a python script.

-load, [plugin]

Checks if the specified plugin (plugin) exists as a python file, and adds to list of existing plugins. For example if you have a plugin whose filename is "plugin.py", you would use the command "load, plugin". This needs to be run before the plugin can be used.
Note that the plugin must be in the same folder as the text editor.

-[plugin] [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] ...

Runs specified plugin (plugin), with as many arguments (arg1, arg2, arg3, ...) as the plugin calls for.
An example of a functioning plugin is the graphing.py plugin.
